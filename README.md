# FOR508 / GCFA Index 

> **Note:** This index is based on the **SANS FOR508 course (2023–present)** and is subject to change as course content evolves.

While I'm sharing my index as a reference, I strongly encourage you to create your own. Building your own index is one of the most effective ways to reinforce your learning and retention. You'll gain a deeper understanding of the material, tools, and techniques by going through the books yourself and organizing the content in a way that makes sense to you.

Use this version to guide your format, structure, or cross-reference — but don't rely on it entirely. Your success on the **GCFA exam** will benefit far more from a personalized index tailored to your own study process.
